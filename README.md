=========

A plugin for MyBB 1.6.x that allows Twitter-style tagging and integration with MyAlerts (https://github.com/euantor/MyAlerts).

While this plugin works with MyAlerts, it is not necessary for the tagging features to work. When MyAlerts is installed integration is enabled by default (in Admin CP) and enabled by default for every user.

One setting is added to the MyAlerts setting group and one setting is added to the Alerts Settings page of the User CP.

*If MyAlerts is installed after this plugin you will need to uninstall and reinstall the plugin to activate alerts.

**If MyAlerts is not installed no settings will be created and that code will not be processed in mention.php

Installation:
============

Copy all the files in the 'Upload' directory to your forum's root directory then Install & Activate the plugin in Admin CP.

Removal:
========

Uninstall the plugin and remove all files.

Upgrade:
=======

Uninstall the plugin and repeat installation instructions replacing old files.

Support:
========

I make no guarantees of support but I will always try. If you need support for this plugin please create a support thread at MyBB forums.
