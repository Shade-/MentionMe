A plugin for MyBB 1.6.x that allows Twitter-style tagging and integration with MyAlerts (https://github.com/euantor/MyAlerts).

While this plugin works with MyAlerts, it is not necessary for the tagging features to work. When MyAlerts is installed integration is enabled by default (in Admin CP) and enabled by default for every user.
