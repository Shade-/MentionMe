MentionMe 1.6.1
=============

A plugin for MyBB 1.6.x that allows Twitter-style tagging and integration with MyAlerts (https://github.com/euantor/MyAlerts).

While this plugin works with MyAlerts, it is not necessary for the tagging features to work. When MyAlerts is installed integration is enabled by default (in Admin CP).
